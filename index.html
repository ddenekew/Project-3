		I'm Daniel Denekew originally from Ethiopia and been
		in chicago for a while. I enjoy playing soccer, going out to the park and
		many out door activites on my spear time. I'm a thirdyear student at IIT and
		i'm enjoying every aspect of learning. its like a therapy to me. I enjoy
		going to school like better than before. I'm eager to learn more and to
		get more knowledge as time passes by. This is wht we do and this is what
		life is all about. I enjoy philosophy in someways. The deep thinking in
		nature dazzles me. Some of the people I listen to on YouTube are the likes
		of Alen Watts and such gives me a high pleasure to enjoy some sort of
		enlightment. I guess. Anyways this is just a test.
		Cheers y'all!!!!!</h5>
